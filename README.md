# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. Built as part of Kaggle's Titanic competition, it explores data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building for binary classification.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset]
- Contains details like age, sex, fare, class, and survival status of passengers.

## 🛠️ Methods Used
- Data Preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy & confusion matrix evaluation

## 🧾 Results
- Achieved good accuracy using Random Forest.
- Focused on simplicity and model interpretability.

## 📁 Files
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with complete workflow.
